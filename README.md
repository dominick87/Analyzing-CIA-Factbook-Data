# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data

In this project, I'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. 

The Factbook contains demographic information like:

`population` - The population as of 2015.
`population_growth` - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
`area` - The total land and water area.

You can download the SQLite database, factbook.db, from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases) or you can find it into the project folder.
